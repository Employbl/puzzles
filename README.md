##Solutions to Facebook Engineering Puzzles##

This repository includes solutions to the Facebook Engineering Puzzles previously hosted
on http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php. Facebook has since discontinued the use
of the Puzzle Robot and this library of puzzles, thus I have decided to make these solutions
publicly accessible. Most of these solutions were hacked together quickly and are likely a
bit sub-optimal, but each passed the Puzzle Robot's test cases and runtime restrictions.

Known references have been included below for each puzzle, where applicable. Some
directories includes sample inputs that were created by others and made available on
the Facebook Puzzles message boards, but the original threads are no longer publicly
available, so the author information is currently unknown.

Thanks go out to all of the folks that created and distributed those test cases,
and actively participated in the discussions on those boards.
