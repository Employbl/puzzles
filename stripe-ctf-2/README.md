## Stripe: Capture the Flag 2.0 (Web Edition)

### About Stripe CTF

At [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), we've found that hands-on experience with exploiting security flaws helps us write more secure code. In February, we built [Stripe Capture the Flag](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag), a security wargame inspired by [SmashTheStack's IO](http://io.smashthestack.org:84/), to help the community (as well our team!) practice identifying and exploiting common security problems. However, this time, instead of focusing on low-level vulnerabilities such as [buffer overflows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow), this CTF 2.0 features web-based vulnerabilities and exploits.

Capture the Flag was built at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) by [Greg Brockman](https://stripe.com/about#greg), [Andy Brody](https://stripe.com/about#andy), [Siddarth Chandrasekaran](https://stripe.com/about#sidd), and [Ludwig Pettersson](https://stripe.com/about#ludwig). Levels were written by Greg, Andy, Sidd, [Andrew Dunham](https://stripe.com/about#andrew), and [Colin Marc](https://stripe.com/about#colin). We'd like to thank our beta testers for their feedback and guidance: [Evan Broder](https://stripe.com/about#evan), [Nelson Elhage](http://nelhage.com/), [Carl Jackson](https://stripe.com/about#carl), [Alex Maccaw](https://stripe.com/about#alex).

### About Stripe

Stripe is a simple, developer-friendly way to accept payments online. We believe that enabling transactions on the web is a problem rooted in code, not finance, and we want to help put more websites in business.

Complexity and opacity have traditionally been hallmarks of online payment processing. We want to fix that.

### Tools

[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/) is a very useful tool for exploring web applications. You may want to read up on [using cURL with cookies](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/http-cookies.html) and [scripting with cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html).

[TamperData](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tamper-data/) is a handy Firefox plugin that can be used to edit HTTP(S) headers and post parameters.

[Edit This Cookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg) is a Chrome extension that lets you add, delete, edit, and manage your cookies.

### Reading materials

If you're new to the world of web security, the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) and the [Google Browser Security Handbook](http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Main) are good places to start.

Google Code University's [Web Security](http://code.google.com/edu/security/index.html) course and Stanford's [Computer and Network Security](http://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/) are both available online and are valuable resources.

Google's [Gruyere codelab](http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/), and [HackThisSite](http://www.hackthissite.org/) provide similar CTF-like environments.
