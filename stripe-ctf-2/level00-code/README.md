## Level 0

Welcome to Capture the Flag! If you find yourself stuck or want to learn more about web security in general, we've prepared a list of helpful [resources](https://stripe-ctf.com/about) for you. You can chat with fellow solvers in the [CTF chatroom](https://answers.stripe.com/chat#ctf) (also accessible in your favorite IRC client at [irc://irc.stripe.com:+6697/ctf](irc://irc.stripe.com:+6697/ctf)).

We'll start you out with Level 0, the Secret Safe. The Secret Safe is designed as a secure place to store all of your secrets. It turns out that the password to access Level 1 is stored within the Secret Safe. If only you knew how to [crack safes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-cracking)...

You can access the Secret Safe at https://level00-1.stripe-ctf.com/user-xxxxxxxxxx. The Safe's code is included below, and can also be obtained via `git clone https://level00-1.stripe-ctf.com/user-xxxxxxxxxx/level00-code`.

### Running

- Run 'npm install' from this directory to install dependencies
- Run 'node level00.js' to start the server on port 3000
- Go to localhost:3000 in your browser
