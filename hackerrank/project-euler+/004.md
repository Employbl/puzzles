## Project Euler #4: Largest palindrome product

### Problem Statement

This problem is a programming version of [Problem 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4) from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/).

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is 101101=143×707.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than ***N***.

### Input Format

First line contains ***T*** that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by ***T*** lines, each containing an integer, ***N***.

### Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case in a new line.

### Constraints

* 1 ≤ ***T*** ≤ 100
* 101101 < ***N*** < 1000000

### Sample Input

    2
    101110
    800000

### Sample Output

    101101
    793397
