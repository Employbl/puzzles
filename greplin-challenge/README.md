## The Greplin Programming Challenge: Version 1

So it begins...

----------------------------------------

Welcome to the Greplin Programming Challenge.  You should try to complete all three levels in a single sitting.  It should take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours.

### Level 1

----------------------------------------

Embedded in [this block of text](https://github.com/robertdimarco/engineering-puzzles/raw/master/greplin-challenge/gettysburg.txt) is the password for level 2. The password is the longest substring that is the same in reverse.

As an example, if the input was "I like racecars that go fast" the password would be "racecar".

Enter the password to access level 2.

### Level 2

----------------------------------------

Congratulations.  You have reached level 2.

To get the password for level 3, write code to find the first prime fibonacci number larger than a given minimum.  For example, the first prime fibonacci number larger than 10 is 13.

When you are ready, go [here](http://challenge.greplin.com/static/nophone.html) or call this automated number (415) 799-9454.

You will receive additional instructions at that time.  For the second portion of this task, note that for the number 12 we consider the sum of the prime divisors to be 2 + 3 = 5.  We do not include 2 twice even though it divides 12 twice.

Enter the password to access level 3.

#### No-phone Instructions

  1. Use your code to compute the smallest prime fibonacci number greater than 227,000.  Call this number X.
  2. The password for level 3 is the sum of prime divisors of X + 1.

Note: If you call the number instead, it will check your answer for step 1.

### Level 3

----------------------------------------

Congratulations.  You have reached the final level.

For the final task, you must find all subsets of an array
where the largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.
For example, for an input of:

(1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

the subsets would be

1 + 2 = 3
1 + 3 = 4
2 + 4 = 6
1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Here is the [list of numbers](https://github.com/robertdimarco/engineering-puzzles/raw/master/greplin-challenge/numbers.csv) you should run your code on. The password is the number of subsets.  In the above case the answer would be 4.

### The End

----------------------------------------

Congratulations.  You completed the challenge.  Your completion code is `***-****-*****`.

We'd love to talk to you - send your completion code, the code you wrote during the challenge, and your resume to [jobs+i+solved+the+challenge@greplin.com](jobs+i+solved+the+challenge@greplin.com)

Even if you're not looking for a job, we'd love to hear what you thought about the challenge.
